ALL about My FYP

For my final year project, I aim to develop an e-commerce platform akin to Amazon, but specifically designed to cater to the needs of customers in Central Asia, starting with Tajikistan. Our primary objective is to offer high-quality products, particularly brand-name clothing, at prices that are more affordable than those found on Amazon and other leading e-commerce sites.

In Tajikistan, acquiring top-tier branded clothing is not only challenging but nearly impossible. As a result, residents often resort to purchasing such items from Russia, which triples the cost when including delivery charges. This has stymied the growth of the fashion industry in Tajikistan.

Furthermore, our platform will feature an online food and daily essentials delivery service. Initially, this service will be exclusive to Suchan in the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. Given the busy lifestyles of today's consumers, this service aims to offer convenience by delivering orders directly to customers' doors. Orders exceeding 1000 somoni will qualify for free delivery. While the food delivery service will begin in Suchan, our long-term vision is to expand our coverage across the entirety of Tajikistan
